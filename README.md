# Plotting-Methods-for-Unknown-Functions
This project will demonstrate how to build graphs of functions unknown to us, given the values in them at some nodes.
Problems of approximation and interpolation.
# Methods:
  1. Lagrangian interpolation polynomial
  2. Newton's interpolation polynomial
  3. Spline Interpolation
